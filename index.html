            I'm not sure if I was supposed to write on the card or not... Like I bought the card thinking that it was blank inside and I was going to write it in there, but I found out the card is not blank...

            Anyways, I love spending the my time with you. From cozy nights watching films together to our dinner dates 
            (which btw I think we order too much sometimes but it do be bussing). You make even the simplest things feel special. I love how we can spend hours just being together, whether 
            it's just cuddled up in the bed or going out to shop for our 500th time in the month, it always feels great to do those things with you again and again.</p>
        <p>
            Uhh about skiing... I know we just started to go skiing together but it do be hella fun. Except that 
            first time when I actaully thought that I was going to get my ass whooped for taking you down the blue run (oops).
            But that's not the worst experience I had skiing with you though. The worst one was when we were on the chairlift with that
            random ass kid and I asked him if he hits any jumps. He was so confused until I told him I meant like sidehits and stuff. Then he proceeds
            to call me out and say I ain't hitting no jumps, they're just hills. Anwyays, 
            I hope we can finally match our skiing outfits next season, and you know... be steezy falling down the slopes.
        </p>

            I'm not sure what else to write because I literally talk to you every single day but, I just want you to know that I’m so grateful to have you in my life—not just on Valentine’s Day, but every single day. You are my favorite person, my happiest place, and the best part of every memory we create. I can’t wait for all the moments still to come, all the new places we’ll go, and all the love we’ll continue to share. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.</p>
        <p class="heart">❤</p>
        <p><strong>Love,</strong><br>Big Backed Baby</p>
