        <h1>Hola My Love</h1>
        <p>
            I'm not sure if I was supposed to write on the card or not... Like I bought the card thinking that it was blank inside and I was going to write it in there, but I found out the card is not blank...
        </p>
        <p>Every moment with you feels like a scene from my favorite movie—the kind where everything just clicks, and I never want it to end. From cozy nights watching films together to our dinner dates filled with laughter and way too many appetizer choices, you make even the simplest things feel special. I love how we can spend hours just being together, whether it’s bundled up on the couch or out exploring new restaurants, always finding joy in the little things.</p>
        <p>Skiing down the slopes with you, even if we spend half the time laughing at ourselves, is one of my favorite adventures. And shopping trips? Let’s be real—you always have the best taste, and I secretly love watching you pick out things with that sparkle in your eye. No matter what we’re doing, you make every experience more fun, more meaningful, and so much more full of love.</p>
        <p>I’m so grateful to have you in my life—not just on Valentine’s Day, but every single day. You are my favorite person, my happiest place, and the best part of every memory we create. I can’t wait for all the moments still to come, all the new places we’ll go, and all the love we’ll continue to share. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.</p>
        <p class="heart">❤</p>
        <p><strong>Forever yours,</strong><br>[Your Name]</p>
